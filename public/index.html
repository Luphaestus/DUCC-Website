                <h1>About Us</h1>

                <div class="about-us-para">
                    <p>Durham University Canoe Club is one of the most successful university canoe clubs in the country.
                        We have something to offer everyone, whatever their ability or level of confidence.</p>
                    <p>The club has a relaxed and very friendly atmosphere. Our activities are flexible so members can
                        come along as often or little as convenient and beginners are always welcome!</p>
                    <p>Our boathouse occupies a prime spot by the River Wear at the Maiden Castle sports centre.</p>
                    <p>
                        We run weekly sessions on the Rivers Wear and Tees as well as in a swimming pool. These sessions
                        cater to all abilities, whether you're a complete beginner looking to try out kayaking/canoeing
                        for the first time or part of our canoe polo teams looking to develop your skills further.
                        Additionally, we run multiple whitewater paddling day trips, weekends away and extended trips
                        across the UK and Europe. For people looking to try out whitewater for the first time or improve
                        their skills, we run multiple 'intro to whitewater sessions’ throughout the year to help you
                        develop the skills and confidence you need to get stuck into one of our trips.
                    </p>
                    <p>If you're interested in competitive paddling, we run regular training sessions for slalom,
                        freestyle, river racing and polo. We're ranked in the top three uni canoe clubs by the British
                        Universities and Colleges Sport organisation.</p>
                    <p>The club runs regular socials, making it a great place to meet new people.</p>
                    <p>If you are interested in joining, talk to one of our exec members or send us an email. Membership
                        is only £55 for the year. Whatever sort of canoeing you might be interested in, this active and
                        friendly club is for you.</p>

                    <h1>Where to Find Us</h1>
                    <p>
                        Our boathouse is located at the Maiden Castle sports centre, which is about a fifteen-minute
                        walk from the Hill colleges and less than half an hour from most other colleges.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To get there, navigate towards "Maiden Castle". The map below shows the precise location of our
                        boathouse on the river.
